# AvaloniaElectroplating  

An Avalonia-based desktop application for calculating surface area and current requirements for zinc plating using the **Gateros Electroplating Kit**.  

This tool makes it easier to determine the correct plating current for bolts, washers, and other parts by providing a quick way to select part sizes, enter custom values, and automatically compute the necessary parameters.

## ✨ Features  

- Cross-platform **GUI** built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)  
- Select standard parts (e.g., bolts, washers in M8, M10, etc.)  
- Add multiple parts to a list for batch calculation  
- Automatically calculates:  
  - Surface area (mm²) / (in²)
  - Current required (mA) for plating  
- Supports custom dimensions and part types

## 📐 Usage  

1. Launch the application.  
2. Select a part type (e.g., *Bolt*, *Washer*) and size (e.g., *M8*, *M10*).  
3. Optionally enter custom dimensions.  
4. Add the part to the list.  
5. The application will:  
   - Sum the surface area of all selected parts.  
   - Calculate the total current required for plating (mA).
